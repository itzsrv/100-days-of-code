# 100 Days Of Code - Log (Round 1)

### Day 0: January 3, 2020
##### Prologue

**Today's Progress**: Setting up the GitHub, getting comfortable with the rules and gimmick of 100 days of code.

**Thoughts**: I get into my own head when it comes to stuff like GitHub, which I'm only vaguely unfamiliar with, and it stops me from committing full force. I can make mistakes! I can do this!

**Link to work**: Not today, but definitely tomorrow!

### Day 1: January 4, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I did the first two problems of Project Euler. Pretty simple to solve, just slight twists on problems that I've seen before. I also finished up the JavaScript: Arrays section (section 13) for Cole Steele's Web Development Bootcamp course on Udemy.

**Thoughts**: This was a good start to the program. Definitely will get more complicated as we keep going (the first two problems of Project Euler only have a 5% difficulty), but mostly felt good to be productive in two different ways today.

### Day 2: January 5, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I did the third and fourth problem of Project Euler. Required a little more thinking than the first two for sure, but still ultimately ended up being pretty simple problems. A good warm-up for what I'm sure is only going to get harder. I also finished up the JavaScript: Objects section (section 14) for Colt Steele's Web Development Bootcamp course on Udemy.

**Thoughts**: This was a good second day, especially before work starts back up. Feels good to be productive in two different ways today. Only stopping today because I have other work to do, otherwise I'm really excited to keep going with this Udemy course. Going to have to eventually work on a project that incorporates the HTML, CSS, and JS I've been learning.

### Day 3: January 6, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I did the fifth and sixth problem of Project Euler. Problem 5 required a couple of functions, while problem 6 was pretty simple. Maybe there's a more efficient way to do it that I'm missing, but it was pretty straightforward, and the challenge seems to have more to do with understanding how to program than understanding the math. I'm going to keep going with Project Euler at least until the end of the week, before maybe slowing down to only a problem a day instead of 2. Also finished the DOM Manipulation section (section 15) for Colt Steele's Web Development Bootcamp course on Udemy.

**Thoughts**: Progress has been pretty good so far. I think the Colt Steele class is going to become slightly more project-based now that we've finished the JavaScript portion, which I'm very excited for.

### Day 4: January 7, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I did the seventh and eighth problem of Project Euler. I wasn't super satisfied with my solutions, but I found the right answer, which at this point I'll take. I might do some independent research to see if I can find more efficient solutions. Also finished the Advanced DOM Manipulation section (section 16) for Colt Steele's Web Development Bootcamp course on Udemy.

**Thoughts**: Progress is definitely going to slow down now that school has started. Even today, I know that I'll have less time to get this stuff down when school really gets underway.
